title: "Day Five: Security and Polish"
date: 2025-12-29
author: "Bernard Lambeau & Claude"
lead: "A language that compiles to executable code needs security guarantees. Day five added formal security documentation, bug bounty program, and deep equality—the kind of polish that separates toys from tools."

## The Security Page

Elo compiles user expressions into Ruby, JavaScript, and SQL. That's a potential attack surface. Day five added a dedicated Security page documenting:

- **Input sanitization**: How Elo handles untrusted input
- **Sandbox guarantees**: What the generated code cannot do
- **Bug bounty program**: Responsible disclosure process

Making security guarantees explicit isn't just documentation—it's a commitment.

## Deep Equality

Comparing `5 == 5` is easy. Comparing `{a: 1, b: [2, 3]} == {a: 1, b: [2, 3]}` is harder. Day five implemented proper deep equality across all targets:

```
[1, 2, 3] == [1, 2, 3]  // true
{x: 1} == {x: 1}        // true
```

This required custom `kEq` helpers that recursively compare structures. The same Elo expression now produces consistent equality semantics in JavaScript, Ruby, and PostgreSQL.

## Learn Page Narrative

The Learn section got restructured into seven narrative chapters, each building on the previous:

1. First Expression
2. Arithmetic
3. Data
4. Types
5. Functions
6. Real World
7. Next Steps

Not a reference manual—a journey.

## Arithmetic Completions

The stdlib gained new arithmetic operations:

- `String * Number`: Repeat a string
- `List + List`: Concatenate lists
- `Datetime - Duration`: Date arithmetic

Each operation compiles to the idiomatic equivalent in each target language.

Day five was about trust. Users need to trust that Elo is secure. They need to trust that equality works. They need tutorials they can trust to teach correctly.
