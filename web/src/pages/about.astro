        <h2>Who's Behind Elo?</h2>
        <p>
          Elo is created by <strong>Bernard Lambeau</strong>, co-founder of <a href="https://enspirit.dev" target="_blank">Enspirit</a>,
          a Belgian software company specializing in data-driven solutions and No-Code tools.
        </p>
        <p>
          With over 25 years of experience in software engineering, programming language design, and implementation, Bernard has built several
          open-source projects including <a href="https://finitio.io" target="_blank">Finitio</a> (a data validation language),
          <a href="https://www.relational-algebra.dev" target="_blank">Bmg</a> (a relational algebra library), and
          <a href="https://klaro.cards" target="_blank">Klaro Cards</a> (a No-Code platform for data management).
        </p>
        <p>
          Elo emerged from these experiences—every tool needed a way for users to write simple, safe expressions.
          Instead of reinventing the wheel each time, Elo provides a shared solution that compiles to Ruby, JavaScript, and SQL.
        </p>

        <h2>Built with AI</h2>
        <p>
          Elo was co-designed by Bernard and <strong>Claude Code</strong> (Anthropic's AI coding assistant),
          and fully implemented by Claude Code under Bernard's supervision. From parser to compilers,
          from tests to documentation—every line of code emerged from this AI-human collaboration.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project demonstrates what's possible when experienced developers partner with AI:
          faster iteration, consistent quality, and the ability to focus on design decisions while
          the AI handles implementation details. Read about the journey on our <a href="/elo/blog">blog</a>.
