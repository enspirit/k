## Problem to solve

* Our parser could be super buggy
* A newcomer could also make syntax errors and never find how to solve them

## Idea

* Let's have the /sceptic check that valid but a bit strange expressions work
  as expected
* Let's also see whether error messages are clear enough for typical errors a
  newcomer could make.

How about adding a section listing typical errors one might encounter and
provide a likely clause and suggested fix ? Where ? Learn or Reference ?
