## Problem to solve

As part of task 69, you didn't do everything needed. There are still lots
of places where Array & Object are used instead of List & Tuple. E.g. with
"literal" word as well.

* Website menus
* Parser & IR

## Idea keep doing.

* Fix it.
* In the Reference documentation, you might add a note saying that our List
  look like javascript/json Arrays and our Tuple look like objects.
