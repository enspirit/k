## Problem to solve

The blog should have a post called "No-Code tools deserve better designed programming

It's a call to Notion, Make, n8n to stop having Excel-like functions, but provide
end-users with better languages : better syntax, semantics, and powerfulness.

## Idea

It can be a bit provocative.
