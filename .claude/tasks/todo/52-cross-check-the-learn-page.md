## Problem to solve

We have a good Learn page, make it great.

## Idea

Ask /rigourous to check our Learn page. What I have in mind

* Is each Fun fact (.lesson-tip) useful and well-placed ?
* Do we have enough of them ?
* No forward reference (we can't use a language feature we have not introduced before)
* We could explain that Elo is a bit like a calculator (no variables, just arithmetics/algebra)
* What objection/question would the learner have in each section
