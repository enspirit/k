## Problem to solve

I'd like the learner to be able to track their progress on the website.

## Idea

Each 1. to 15 section could be "Marked as read" or "Completed" and would
then be closed. Possibly the menu could reflect completed sections with a small
check icon too.

The state could be maintained accross visits via a simple local storage
persistence.
