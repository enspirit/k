## Problem to solve

The current website has only one page and a few anchors. This is not super
SEO friendly, nor allows bookmarking sections or subsections easily.

How can we improve that ?

## Idea

Either :

* Move to a multi-pages website
* Or provide an implementation that hacks the URL in such a way that it looks
  like a multi-pages website as far as SEO/bookmarks are concerned.
