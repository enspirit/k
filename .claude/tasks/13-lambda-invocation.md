## Problem to solve

We just added support for lambda function like `( x | x * 2 )`. To be truly
useful though, one should be able to invoke them. For instance, the following
should work:

```k
let
  double = ( x | x * 2 )
in
  assert(double(2) == 4)
```

## Idea

Let's add that :-)

How will we distinguish from invoking a lambda and invoking a stdlib function ?

## Post-implementation discussion

- Explain what happens if a user introduces a named lambda (let) that clashes with a stdlib function name. Add acceptance tests
necessary to prove the wanted behavior (with assertions).
