## Problem to solve

We have a base K language, that might prove very useful for NoCode tools like
Klaro Cards.

Where should we go from here ? Let's restate our goal:

Design a simple, well-designed, portable and safe (purely functional) expression
language to support 80% of business cases in those NoCode tools.

## Idea

I have a couple of ideas to move forward, but want your Claude Code opinion.

List 5 to 10 next steps, very pragmatic ones, by order of priority, taking
into account that the target is non-tech users. You can propose :

- Language improvements (more types ?)
- Stdlib improvements
- Website improvements
- Compiler API improvements
