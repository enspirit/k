## Problem to solve

People who want to try Elo on their own computed will not find the info
clearly enough.

## Idea

* Add a `Get started` button next to `Try it now` on home page.
* Link to to the Tools section of the Reference page (should we rename it Get started ?)
* In that section, make sure anyone coming with our without background on programming
  has clear next steps to use Elo and it's compiler in various settings.
* Cross-check that `eloc` and `elo` can be used in an idiomatic way to run a program
  in an `.elo` file.
