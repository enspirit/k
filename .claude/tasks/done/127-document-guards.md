## Problem to solve

Two commits ago, we added support for guards, in let and pipe syntaxes.

I think they deserve more documentation :

1. Add an example before relational algebra on home page. Explain that reasoning
   about programs is key.
2. Add a few examples in Try's example dropdown.
3. Add a Learn step + exercices
