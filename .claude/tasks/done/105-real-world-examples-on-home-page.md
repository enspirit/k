## Problem to solve

A few suggested improvements on home page:

1. Replace "Temporal arithmetics" card by something a bit more general that
   emphasizes what makes Elo special (temporal arithmetics and data schemas
   come to mind at least)
2. End of "Elo vs JavaScript" section, I would put a quick sentence and link
   inviting the user to visit the Use case section of the Learn page.
3. Btw there is a vertical spacing issue above Form Validation. Lack of space
   don't know why.
