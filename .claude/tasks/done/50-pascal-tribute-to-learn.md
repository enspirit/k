## Problem to solve

I learned programming with Turbo Pascal. Was a simple, great language.

I think Elo could "compete" somehow. It could be a great entry for beginners
to programming, especially because it's roots into functional & relational
programming make things simple (everything is a value, functions as first class,
etc.).

## Idea

How about having a section on the website that allow newcomers/non-tech people
(remember, our target is no-code users) to learn, about Elo of course, but also
about programming in general.

Any idea how we can do that ?
