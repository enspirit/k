## Problem to solve

I'm a bit annoyed by the Reference page's table of content. Are we sure the
structure is adequate ?

Unlike Learn, Reference does not help discovering the language, but defining
it in a well structured way. It should also be complete.

## Idea

Let's see if we can find a better table of content, and reorganize/complete
the existing material.
